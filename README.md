# Srinivasan CodingSample

The analysis associated with the writing sample is presented here.    

## Brief Description

In this set of R codes I present the JAGS specification for the cross classified model with teachers and raters crossed at level-2. In this particular model I have placed a normal distributional assumption on the random effects terms and a uniform prior on the variance components. The code also includes diagnotics for the model and plotting various posterior distributions for various parameters of interest.

The Appendix B1 of the associated writing sample has detailed description about the data and model specifications.
